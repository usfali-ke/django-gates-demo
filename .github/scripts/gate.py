"""Assemble one gate decision from the control verdicts of this run.

Every control is its own job ending in verdict.py; a gate criterion is
answered by one or more of them (secrets = gitleaks + trufflehog). This file is the single list of which job answers which dashboard
criterion (keys: the dashboard's docs/GATE_INGEST_API.md).

    NEEDS='${{ toJSON(needs) }}' python3 .github/scripts/gate.py G1 out.json

NEEDS can also be a job's own `toJSON(steps)`: a step's outputs have the
same shape, so a job that runs several controls can name its verdict steps
after them. The pipelines don't: every control is its own job.
PROFILE picks another criteria list for the same gate (GATES["G3@staging"]).

A criterion is:
  fail     if any of its controls failed, or didn't leave a verdict (a
           crashed, cancelled or skipped job is never an implicit pass);
  skipped  if a control reported `skipped` (couldn't be evaluated in this
           context, e.g. no signature on a pull request) — not a pass;
  pass     only when every control passed.
The gate passes only when every criterion passes, except the keys in
ALLOW_SKIPPED (comma-separated) which may be `skipped` — used on pull
requests, where the image is built and tested but never published.

Writes gate-result.json (a GateEvaluationIn body), the job summary, and
`status=pass|fail` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
